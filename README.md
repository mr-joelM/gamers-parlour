## Description

Gamers Parlour is a place for games reviews and comments rating, and a website which interacts with the backend API I created previously.
This project is a React app built using JavaScript. Using Axios and Fetch to make API calls to my Gamers Parlour Backend API and React Router to render the app's different components. The app was created with JSX styled with CSS.
